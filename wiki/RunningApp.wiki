How to run the app:

Check it out.

Figure out where dev_appserver.py lives:

$ which dev_appserver.py

which should give you the full path, something like:
/usr/local/bin/dev_appserver.py

Use python2.5 to run it in the directory you checked out (note the period for current workind directory).
$ python2.5 /usr/local/bin/dev_appserver.py .   

Then visit http://localhost:8080
